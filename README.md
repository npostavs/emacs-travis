Pre-built Emacs binaries for Travis CI.

Usage
=====

Add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

``` yaml
language: generic
sudo: false

env:
  matrix:
    - EMACS_VERSION=23.4
    - EMACS_VERSION=24.5
    - EMACS_VERSION=25.3
    - EMACS_VERSION=master
  allow_failures:
    - env: EMACS_VERSION=master

install:
  - curl -LO https://github.com/npostavs/emacs-travis/releases/download/bins/emacs-bin-${EMACS_VERSION}.tar.gz
  - tar -xaf emacs-bin-${EMACS_VERSION}.tar.gz -C /
  # Configure $PATH: Emacs installed to /tmp/emacs
  - export PATH=/tmp/emacs/bin:${PATH}
  # Install dependencies for older Emacs versions which lack them.
  # Introduced in Emacs 24.3.
  - if ! emacs -Q --batch --eval "(require 'cl-lib)" ; then
        curl -Lo cl-lib.el http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/cl-lib-0.6.1.el ;
    fi
  # Introduced in Emacs 24.1
  - if ! emacs -Q --batch --eval "(require 'ert)" ; then
        curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohler/ert/c619b56c5bc6a866e33787489545b87d79973205/lisp/emacs-lisp/ert.el &&
        curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohler/ert/c619b56c5bc6a866e33787489545b87d79973205/lisp/emacs-lisp/ert-x.el ;
    fi
  - emacs --version

script:
  - make
  - make check
```

This setup tests your Emacs Lisp project on Emacs 23.4, 24.5, 25.3,
and the latest Emacs `master` version (assuming you have a `Makefile`
with a `check` target which runs your tests).  It includes code for
installing cl-lib and ert for older Emacs versions, you can remove
those steps if your package/tests don't depend on them (or your
package requires newer Emacs versions which already include them).

All point releases starting from 23.4 are also available if you want
to test more versions in between.  Daily builds of from the git
repository branches `master` and `emacs-26` are available as versions
`master` and `26`, respectively.  The latest pretest or release
candidate from the `emacs-26` branch is available as version
`26-prerelease` (this is updated manually, so may lag by a few days).
